    "Generally, we are dealing with fairly incompressible fluids. Therefore, oscillations in density are small. However, this picture is not the same for pressure. Small oscillations in density give rise to large oscillations in pressure. Let's say that acoustic pressure in room is ~0.1 MPa. In ultrasound, the pressure can be at least 10x this at the transducer interface. The pressure waveform spans both positive and negative pressure. When there is 0 pressure, there is a vacuum. For negative pressure, the water molecules have a temporary \"glue\" with the wall. As the molecules move back, they also drag the wall back with them. ??Confused about this! Ask later."
